# Vue Playlist Filters

This track list can be sorted by title, artist, and album. A user can also enter text to search this list by song title. A [personal playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/hexagoncircle/playlist/5UuLjMciDTvfc2rCBwHMIT?si=KJbnDgcJRSy1iZjO2c4WnQ) JSON was exported from [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-playlist) for this prototype.
